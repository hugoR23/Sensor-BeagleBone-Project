We received and/or read data from the sensor, and we work on it in order to make it fit the following specifications.
We give it to the client, and it's his role to adapt this data for an optimal transmission to the server.
Then, the server gives it back, and we assume that the data he gives also fit those specifications.

Data format:

Data is sent in the form of a dictionary which contains several lists of tuples.
The dictionary keys represent the data type which is associated to this key (temperature, pressure, etc.).
For example:
    dict["TEMPERATURE"] = [tuple1, tuple2, tuple3]
    dict["PRESSURE"] = [tuple4, tuple5, tuple6, tuple7]
The possible keys are (for the moment!) the following ones:
    TEMPERATURE (in °C), PRESSURE (in bar), HUMIDITY (in %), LUMINOSITY (in lux)
    
A tuple is in the form of: (date, value).
The date is the number of secondes elapsed since January 1st 1970.
The value is a floating point value which can possibly be negative.
The list is sorted from the oldest value to the most recent one.
Once the values are sent, they are deleted and will not be sent again. It's the role of the receiver to store the data.
